o Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she
expected to find in your project?
    The final user will be a company or a person who is interested in knowing about my trajectory for a possible hiring, so he/she expects to find my work experience, my studies, projects I am participating, my skills, to know a little about me and obviously different ways to contact me in case of any doubt or for the hiring.

o Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis isnâ€™t very relevant
    First there is some information about who I am and different contact methods, then there are the studies I am studying or already have, then there is my work experience, then the projects I am participating in and finally the skills I have.

o Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography?
Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects
    Color palette:
        #3e4a58 -> this color is for the header and footer, it delimits the space well.
        #9dd4e2 -> this color is the main color, it is the most colorful and catches the eye of the users.
        #ceecf4 -> this color is used to delimit sections within the headland, to draw attention within the section.

    There are two typography:
        monospace, serif -> for the titles
        Verdana,Arial, serif -> for text

    The page simulates that it is a business card located in the middle of the page and has different sections. By not occupying the entire page and being divided by parts it seems to be more dynamic and with less text to read, thus facilitating and ensuring the reading of users.
